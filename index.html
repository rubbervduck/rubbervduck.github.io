<h3>Some places I worked</h3>
        <ul class="list-disc">

          <li><strong>Research Intern @ RAFT Group, IIT Hyderabad</strong></li>
          <p class="description">
            During my time at the RAFT Group, IIT Hyderabad, under the guidance of 
            <a href="https://www.iith.ac.in/ce/satishr/" target="_blank">Dr. Satish Regonda</a>, 
            I worked on flood extent mapping and flood depth estimation using computer vision. 
            I built and annotated datasets, benchmarked semantic segmentation models, and automated pipelines for object detection and keypoint tracking in flood imagery. 
            I also explored semi-supervised learning to reduce manual labeling and improve model adaptability across diverse flood scenarios.
          </p>

          <li><strong>Machine Learning Intern @ Stemtec AI and Robotics Pvt Ltd</strong></li>
          <p class="description">
            During my time at Stemtec, under the guidance of 
            <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Balakrishnan-Ramalingam" target="_blank">Dr. Balakrishnan Ramalingam</a>, 
            I researched and implemented perception systems for autonomous mobile robots (AMRs), 
            focusing on semantic segmentation and context-aware object detection. 
            Additionally, I contributed to the development of a telepresence robot integrated with a large language model (LLM) for Human-Robot Interaction.
          </p>

            <li><strong>Samsung Prism Research Intern @ Samsung R&D Institute India</strong></li>
            <p class="description">
              During my time as a Project/Prism Intern at Samsung, 
              I worked on developing deep learning models for speech restoration and enhancement. 
              My focus was on creating lightweight models designed for resource-constrained environments, 
              enabling precise audio analysis and restoration, particularly for deployment on devices like smartphones.</p>
        </ul>
    
        <h3>My past projects</h3>

        <h3>My Blogs</h3>
        <ul class="list-disc">
          Work in progress, hopefully will be up soon.
            <!-- <li><a href="http://github.com/anirudhhramesh/micrograd">ML Training & Inference Engine (from scratch)</a> <span class="description">Re-built PyTorch/Micrograd from first principles. Reviewed derivatives, backprop. Trained a hotdog classifier.</span></li> -->

        <h3>Backlog of projects I want to build</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Decoding Semantic Segmentation</strong>
                <span class="description">
                  I am working on the most comprehensive blog on semantic segmentation, where I explain the concept from first principles. The blog covers traditional segmentation techniques and gradually transitions into state-of-the-art deep learning architectures published over the years highlighting what each method introduced, how they differ, and their implementations.
                  While the core emphasis is on building a strong conceptual and practical understanding, the blog also explores interpretability through key research papers and implementations.
                </span>
            </li>

            <li><strong>Image Inpainting Tool</strong>
            <span class="description">
              Designed and developed an image inpainting system inspired by tools like Adobe Photoshop’s Content-Aware Fill and Google’s Magic Eraser. 
              Initially implemented patch-based inpainting based on the paper 
              <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1604.07379" target="_blank" style="color: inherit; text-decoration: underline;">
                "Context Encoders: Feature Learning by Inpainting"
              </a>, and later transitioned to DDPMs for high-fidelity object removal and semantic image editing.
            </span>
          </li>
